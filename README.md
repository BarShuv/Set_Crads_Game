This project is an assignment I completed for my "SPL" course at university, which focuses on utilizing various synchronization mechanisms in Java.

The objective of this project is to implement a "Set" game where players can choose the number of human participants and computer participants. Additionally, players have the option to configure the speed of the computer participants. The challenge was to ensure smooth gameplay without bugs, even when multiple participants (each represented by a thread) are involved, especially at high game speeds.

WHAT I APPRECIATED ABOUT THIS ASSIGNMENT

What I appreciated about this assignment was the opportunity to deeply understand and apply Java's synchronization mechanisms. The project required the use of synchronization primitives such as blocking queues, semaphores, and the wait and notify methods. Implementing these mechanisms effectively ensured thread safety and smooth coordination between multiple concurrent threads. I found that mastering synchronization is essential for writing robust concurrent programs and is a valuable skill for any Java developer.

HOW TO RUN

The main function in the Java code is located in: src/main/java/Main.java. If you open the project with VSCode or any other Java IDE, you can run it from there. To configure the settings of the game, such as the speed of computer players, you can modify the relevant parameters within the code.
