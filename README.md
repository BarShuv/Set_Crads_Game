This project is an assignment I completed for my "SPL" course at university, which focuses on utilizing various synchronization mechanisms in Java.

The objective of this project is to implement a "Set" game where players can choose the number of human participants and computer participants. Additionally, players have the option to configure the speed of the computer participants. The challenge was to ensure smooth gameplay without bugs, even when multiple participants (each represented by a thread) are involved, especially at high game speeds.

WHAT I APPRECIATED ABOUT THIS ASSIGNMENT

What I appreciated about this assignment was the opportunity to deeply understand and apply Java's synchronization mechanisms. The project required the use of "key holder" objects for synchronization management, as well as atomic queues and stacks, the compareAndSet method, and volatile variables. I found that mastering synchronization is akin to mastering an art form.
HOW TO RUN

The main function in the Java code is located in: src/main/java/Main.java. If you open the project with VSCode or any other Java IDE, you can run it from there. To configure the settings of the game, such as the speed of computer players, you can modify the relevant parameters within the code.
